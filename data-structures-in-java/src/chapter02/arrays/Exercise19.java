 * 
 * The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an array of boolean elements whose ith element is true if and
 * only if i is a prime number. 
 * Use the following algorithm to compute and print a sieve of size 1000:
 * 1. Initialize p[0] and p[1] to be false, and all other p[i] to be true.
 * 2. Repeat step 3 for each i from 3 to n, incrementing by 2.
 * 3. If there is a prime the square root of i that divides i, set p[i] false.
